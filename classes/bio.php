        <p id="iAM">I'm a Chicago-native, who is a Full Stack Developer from Streamwood, IL, interested in entrepreneurship and bringing ideas/solutions to life with scalable web pages.
        I code in PHP, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and frameworks. I design in HTML, and CSS/SASS. I make web servers play nice and I socialize with databases(mySQL and Postgres).
        I create custom themes and modifiy plugins for WordPress and Drupal CMS. I enjoy getting to know the customer while in the User Experience and website design phase.
        I enjoy turning complex web developement issues into simple solutions that an eight yrs old could understand. But mainly I love my young adults children, playing basketball with them.</p>
